# Documenting Go Code With Beautiful Tests

📆 August 2nd, 2018

🗺️ London, 🇬🇧

🏛️ [GopherCon UK 2018](https://www.gophercon.co.uk)

## Description

Whether you believe in TDD or not, you must agree that it's unwise to build production code with no tests. They verify your application, but also act as a perfect documentation for the development team. I would like to show a couple of tips and tricks of how you can write pretty and effective tests.
