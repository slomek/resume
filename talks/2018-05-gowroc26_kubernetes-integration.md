## Description

One of the hardest things to do when building microservice architecture is to have a proper monitoring and visibility of all the working parts. I would like to share with you how we build a small, yet powerful integration with Kubernetes API and Slack to provide us with the insights of how our services operate, how they rely on each other, and how the development team can get notified every time something is wrong, or even when it’s just slightly off.
