## Description

Creating a website from scratch is very rewarding, but at the same time highly impractical. You may spend a month figuring the most basic stuff, and all you wanted to do is create a simple blog. Buffalo is a framework that handles most of the boring stuff, leaving you focused on the business logic. During my, talk I'll show you how to have an up-and-running website in minutes, using our beloved Go.
