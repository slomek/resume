## Description

For a long time building an API (eg. for web applications) has become associated with REST. Meanwhile, less than two years ago, Facebook announced a technology they've been using for some time called GraphQL which is an alternative way to provide data to the users, where each client can squeeze multiple queries into a single one. During my talk I'll show how to create a simple GraphQL API in Go, and show some practical examples when it performs way better than REST.
